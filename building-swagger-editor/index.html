# Rendering Fast

* ### Rendering is not fast! Specially if spec is large.
* ### Throttling the render task is reasonable.
* ### AngularJS do not re-render entire HTML when scope changes partially, don't override the scope on each keypress

# Keeping typing experience smooth

### Each task can fail in it's own way

# Change listening and change listeners

      changeListeners[key] = [];

# A new problem

<img src="images/wrong_order.png" alt="Wrong order" width="100%">

---

# A new problem
## JSON does not care about property <b>order</b>, therefore Swagger operation and responses may lose their order during YAMLâ†’JSON conversion


---

class: center, middle

# We need to sort object properties based on their position in YAML


---

# Some processors sort keys alphabetically
```yml
foo:
  jaz: 2
  bar: 1
```

```json
{
  "foo": {
    "bar": 1,
    "jaz": 2
  }
}
```

---

### To sort properties based on their position in the YAML we need an abstract syntax tree (AST) of the YAML

---

#### What is an AST?

<img src="images/ast.png" alt="AST" width="100%">

---

```yml
foo:
  jaz: 2
  bar: 1
```

```yaml
value:
      value: "foo"
      start_mark:
        line: 0
        column: 0
      end_mark:
        line: 0
        column: 3
      value:
            value: "jaz"
            start_mark:
              line: 1
              column: 2
            end_mark:
              line: 1
              column: 5
            value: "2"
            start_mark:
              line: 1
              column: 7
            end_mark:
             ....

```

---
### Using an array instead of objects to keep the order

```yaml
/:
 get: ...
 post: ...
```

```js
{
  "post": { /* ... */ },
  "get": { /* ... */ }
}
```

```js
{
  "operations": [
    {
      "operationsName": "get", /* ... */
    },
    {
      "operationsName": "post", /* ... */
    }
  ]
}
```

  column: 8
